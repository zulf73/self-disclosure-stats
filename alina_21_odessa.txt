Hi there ! I will try to be brief so as not to waste your time. Cos I dont want to be annoying woman in ur eyes ! ))) Of course it is very difficult to tell all my thoughts in this letter. First of all, I want to say that I came to find a man who is interested in family life. I need a man who is as interested in family life as I am. I'm young and bright woman. But you and me understand that is too little) True ? I have sincerity. I know how to create and maintain the right relationship. The man next to me will not know everyday problems. Our house will be clean and cozy because I'm a great housewife. Our fridge will be full of delicious food because I'm a great cook. I am a woman who is not afraid of difficulties and I will always be with my man, in any situation. Of course I'm not perfect. Any person has pros and cons. But, with this easy to handle if you have a sincere desire to be together. Are u agree with me ?
