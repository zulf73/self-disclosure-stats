Hello, darling ! How are you? Are you feeling happy at the moment? Or you are feeling someone is missing in your life? My heart is half-empty at the moment. So I am here looking for my true soulmate to ing harmony and peace into my life. I do not like to talk at random and live all my life in dreams. I clearly know what should be done to make my life with future husband happy and easy. I can share all with you, of course. Well, I have chosen to write you this letter because it seems to me that men from your country are a lot different. And I wish you could tell me in more details what does relationship and family means for you? and you be fully devoted to your close people? What makes me stand out of many women here is that I am aware of all difficulties and advantages moving to foreign country and starting relations with a foreign man. I am ready for that and it is not a game for me. I hope you are that man who is missing an energetic, smiling, tender and romantic woman for relationship and ight future. Thank you for taking time and reading my letter! I am looking forward to your reply!
