You explained your point of view very nicely! I understand you very well! Nobody likes love to be tricked. This is very unpleasant. I would even say it's tragic! It seems to me that you are a little disappointed in the relationship, right? If I'm wrong, then I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you! People whom we love very much come into our life more than once and we hope that this is mutual and forever. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. But the main thing is to believe that we are worthy of the most devoted love. Do you think so too? As for long-distance relationships, it is on the conscience of every person. If I love someone, even if there is a great distance between us, I will not be able to betray my love. Do you believe that there is still light and pure love in the world?
