Hi! Its almost the end of year! So I decided to write to you first and find out how you want to Celebrate Christmas ? This is a family holiday . How do you usually celebrate it in your family,Do u have a special tradition of celebration ? Do you have any special traditions ? Delicious dinner, fun company doesn't sound bad . WOULD YOU LIKE TO KISS ME UNDER THE MISTLETOE? We don't have such a tradition, but I would like to try it. HAVE you watched Christmas movies ? I want a sense of celebration and new year's mood . But it's so hard to focus on fun now when the world is in such trouble . I hope the new year will bring us a lot of happiness and joy . New love and new meetings . New year new life ! I would like to wish you a merry Christmas that day , would you like to receive my congratulations ? I'm writing to you because I think we have something in common and I want to make sure of it . Do u wanna meet with me in new 2021?
