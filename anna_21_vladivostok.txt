Hey! How are you there ? You may find it strange, but something prompted me to write to you)) And I trust this feeling! Mmmm))) Surely you are interested to know)) so I will gladly tell you about my thoughts! My first impression of a person is always correct and clearly described and I believe it. I did not hesitate to write to you, but I just did it! Of course, what is usually indicated in profiles for dating is not enough to understand what a person really is, but I feel what are you special! And you may say that I am exaggerating, but I ask you to give me the opportunity to prove to you that this is exactly the case! I am looking for real LOVE, I want to build strong relationships based primarily on trust and mutual respect. Do u want a serious relations too ?
