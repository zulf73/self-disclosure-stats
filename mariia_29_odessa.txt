I just want you to know for sure. I communicated with you, and in the hope of your words, I thought that a man like you knows how to behave normally and dialogue! Yes, everything was fine, but not always so perfect. if you feel bored for a moment, it doesn't mean that you should go to another girl who has attracted more attention. It's strange, it's not people who do this, but bots. I think you're just looking for fun. a real person cannot be perfect .. and we even discussed it. That is, if you don't ask me questions. and you are not interested in me normally. This should not mean that you are bored with my questions. From questions, from communication, from the first acquaintance, a real relationship begins! Ok .. apparently you don't want a relationship! okay, a present for you, a surprise. come on .. write and tell me to surprise you. And you will go nuts from what I show you. ok .. if you don't want to speak normally, then it will speak differently. After all, I'm bored, and I can pay attention in different ways to make it fun! but if this happens .. then there will be no normal and serious relationship! Here's an example of a photo, and even a video, so that you understand what I'm talking about .. you wanted this from me at the beginning of communication?
