Hi ! How are u there ? i hope u feel yourself good! I just want to talk with you ... I want to tell you that I am so happy that I have a chance to write to you ! I hope my letter to you will be interesting. I want to be honest with you. I want to trust my man. I want my man to believe me for 100%. I think that it is very important in the relationship. Do u agree with me ? It is a big part of the trustful relationships, am I right? I want romance: affectionate letters in the morning and evening, nice gifts, and output with the carousels and cotton candy. How do you feel about it? Do you like romantic? Could you tell that you are romantic person? It is really interesting for me to know your ideas. Wish you a lot of happiness,
