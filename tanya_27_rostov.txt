All my life I have dreamed of experiencing true love. I dreamed of being loved and loving. Unfortunately, this has not happened in my life yet. But I came here in the hope that I will find a man who will love me as much as I love him. Yes, I still believe that between a woman and a man there can be not only passion, but also tenderness, care, love and of course warmth. My dream is a happy family, children, love with my family. I want to have a stable business and help my parents (and my man's parents). I know that you may be reading this and understand what you would like to write to me. I will not be against it at all... perhaps you are looking for a woman here with whom you want to have a family, children? Perhaps you are looking for the one you want to love and receive love, warmth, passion, care from her? I will be glad to see your letter or SMS from you, if you still decide to tell me why you are here)
